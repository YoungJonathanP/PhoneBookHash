// An Empirical Investigation of Hash Functions - PhoneBook
//
//The file phonebook.txt contains 46,332 names and telephone numbers, one per line, with the
//name separated from the phone number by a tab character. Write a program which reads this
//file, stores its contents into a hash table with 4177 entries using separate chaining, and then
//outputs information necessary to produce a histogram as described below. You will use this
//program to investigate the performance of different hash functions.
//

// Organizes and tests our first hashing function
// receives input from main which reads file. Outputs test to an external file
void testHash1(){

}

// Organizes and tests our first hashing function
